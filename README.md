SARTA and FTC Utility Scripts

Various matlab scripts used in the derivation of fast coefficients, supporting SARTA
development, test and validation, roughly grouped as follows:

1. Fast Coefficients.

doall_wrtconvdat_generic.m

rdcoef.m, rd_con*.m, wrtcoef.m, wrt_con*.m

wrt_tunmlt_ones.m

2. SARTA development:

make_r49*.m,  make_refprof.m

write_solardata_for_sarta.m, interp_solar_to_sensor_grid.m

3. SARTA Testing:

compare_kc_sar_r49*.m

4. NonLTE training:
